Disclaimer: This program may not work with your specific sequences as it has not been optimized for every scenario. 

Designer.py is a python file that is used to visualize the gRNA as well as the homology arm primers used for our a CRISPR flag insertion preceding a stop codon. It is run with our specific paramters from main.py, but those paramters can be changed for your specific primers and gRNA. 

The program will generate homology arms of a specified length away from your cut site and save them in .txt files which can be fed to a primer generation tool online such as by NCBI. Designer.py confirms all sequences given to it as well as the sequence printed to the screen. 

Designer.py also allows for the addition of gibson assembly sequences and gRNA overhangs as specified by the protocols in ../README.
